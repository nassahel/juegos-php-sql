# Juegazos




## Purpose

[IN REMODELING] This web page presents a login screen with common user and administrator roles, where login data is stored in session variables. Administrator users can add, edit and delete users, as well as edit, modify and delete games. On the other hand, common users can add games to the cart and select a preferred game genre, which will be displayed in the favorites section; this preference is saved as a cookie.

This project was developed as part of the final work of the first year at the university. Although it already has functionality, I am currently working on remodeling its aesthetic aspect. You can access the page using the following credentials: User: luis, Password: luis.
